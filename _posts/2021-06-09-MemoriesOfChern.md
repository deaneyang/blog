## My Memories of S. S. Chern
### By C. T. Yang (as told to D. Yang)

### In China

Chern was born in Jiaxing, Zhejiang but his father moved his
family to Tianjin. Chern did very well there and entered Nankai University when
he was only 15. At that time the Nankai math department consisted of one
person, [Jiang Lifu][3] (1890-1978), who taught all of the courses. Jiang was from
the same county as me, Pingyang County in Zhejiang. After graduating from
Nankai, Chern went first to Qinghua University, but soon left for Germany, where he studied with
Blaschke, and France, where he studied with Elie Cartan. He then returned to
China. By then the war had forced the three major universities in Beijing to
relocate temporarily in Kunming as a single combined Southwest Associated University,
where Chern became a professor. Also there at that time was [L. K. Hua][2]<sup>[1](#hua)</sup>. At that time,
Hua and Chern were viewed as the two top young mathematicians in China.

The Academia Sinica started an Institute of Mathematics in
Shanghai and appointed Jiang to be the head of the institute. Jiang in turn
named Chern as the acting head of the Institute and returned to Nankai. Chern
recruited the best students in China to come to the Institute as research
assistants. They had no official duties, except to study mathematics. Chern
himself would lecture twelve hours a week. One was the well-known topologist Wu
Wen-Tsun. During Chern’s tenure at the Institute, he was very successful in
training a whole generation of Chinese mathematicians in a broad range of
fields.

I got to know Chern just by accident. I was probably the
last research assistant brought to the Institute by Chern. I had graduated from
Zhejiang University in 1946 and spent two more years there as a teaching
assistant. I wanted to be a research mathematician, but had no means of
pursuing this. I just read by myself. It just happened that a good friend of
mine was at the Institute, and he told me how interesting Chern’s lectures
were. He told me it would be good for me to go there. He also told Chern about
me and said that, when we were in college, I was better than him. Chern knew that university math departments were
always reluctant to let their best students go elsewhere, so he said that if
the head of the math department would write a letter to him agreeing to let me
go to the Institute, Chern would take me. Luckily, the department head was Su
Buchin, who-like Jiang and me- was also born in Pingyang County, agreed.

I went to the Institute in the summer of 1948. By then the
Institute had moved with the Nationalists to Nanjing. Chern had been invited to
visit the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton and left Nanjing soon after
I arrived. I did not get to attend any of Chern’s lectures, but was able to
study topology and algebraic topology from notes taken by the other students of
Chern’s lectures. I had always had a strong interest in geometry, so I had no
difficulty switching to topology.

By the end of 1948, the Communists were winning the war, and
the Institute followed the Nationalists to Taiwan. Only three senior
mathematicians, (Jiang, S. T. Hu, and H. C. Wang) and three junior
mathematicians (Liao, Chen, and me) went to Taiwan. Jiang and Chen would return
to the mainland in 1949, while Hu, Wang, and I went to the U.S. Hu first went
to Tulane as an assistant professor and later became a full professor at UCLA.
Wang started at LSU and later became a professor at Cornell. Both were
outstanding mathematicians, Hu in homotopy theory and Wang in Lie groups. Liao
would go to Chicago, where he worked with Chern.

With the help of Chern, Wang, and Hu, I was offered a
teaching fellowship at Tulane. To get a visa for the U.S., I had to provide
evidence of enough financial means to stay for at least two years. The stipend
was not enough for the visa requirements. Chern deposited $2,400 into a bank
account and sent me the receipt, so that I could get the visa.

### In the U.S.

I did not see Chern much in the U.S. I visited him a few
times in both Chicago and Berkeley.

In 1952, right after I received my Ph.D., I visited Chern in
Chicago, where he helped me gain access to the university library.

In 1953 I asked Chern for advice on a problem I faced. I was
a research associate at the University of Illinois. A professor and his
graduate students were working on a conjecture of Freeman Dyson. I attended
their seminars, learned about the conjecture, and started working on it myself.
Soon after that, I produced a proof. When the professor heard about it, he told
me he almost had it, too. But I knew he didn’t. Our ideas were close but
different. I didn’t know what to do. I went to see Chern and asked him how to
handle this situation. Chern said that the best way would be to write a joint
paper, but that I should wait until the professor suggests it. He also told me
that if the professor does not suggest it within a few months, I should go ahead,
write it up, and publish it. And that’s what I did. This was one of my best
results. Of course, the professor in question was upset, because he and all of
his students had been working on it for several years.

### In China

Chern had a close relationship with Nankai University. The
university started an institute of mathematics, and Chern was the first
director. The university built visitor housing, including a residence reserved
primarily for Chern. We also stayed in the same building, whenever we visited
Nankai. From ’89 to ’95 I visited Nankai every year for several weeks, mainly
because Chern asked me to. That happened because Chern once was invited to give
some special lectures at Drexel around ’88. He heard I would retire in ’91. He
told me it was too early to do nothing. He asked me to visit the new institute
at Nankai.

In China Chern was a famous person. So from time to time
there would be somebody who would want to visit him, but he wouldn’t try to see
everyone. But he did make some interesting friends, including someone who was
one of the top go players in China and a bridge partner of Deng Xiao Ping.
In ’95 we visited Nankai, while Chern was also there. Chern
invited the go player to stay for a few days as his houseguest.

We would have all of our meals together with Chern. My wife
usually planned the menu in advance and bought the ingredients. She would cook,
even though we had a kitchen staff. Chern loved to play mah-jong, but we
wouldn’t play for money. We would just keep track on paper. Also, Chern was not
walking well, but he needed to take walks. During those few weeks, every
morning we took him for a walk for twenty minutes. This was the last time we
were together with Chern and his wife.

<a name="hua">[1]:</a> Hua himself had an interesting background. He had maybe only 9 years of formal
education, but had to return home to work in his father’s store. But he studied
math and managed to publish two articles in a journal. A professor recognized
his talent and made arrangements for him to work at Qinghua University as an
assistant. He was soon promoted to a research assistant. G. H. Hardy learned
about Hua’s talent and made arrangements for Hua to visit Cambridge for a year
during which Hua wrote at least fifteen papers. Afterwards, Hua returned to
China and became a professor at the Southwest Associated University from 1936
until 1945. Hua went on to have a distinguished career as a mathematician and a
leader in the Chinese academic community. (Some of the details of Hua’s life
are taken from: Sheng Gong, <i>The Life and Work of Famous Chinese
Mathematician Loo-keng Hua</i>, Advances in Applied Clifford Algebras 11(2001)
9-20.)
