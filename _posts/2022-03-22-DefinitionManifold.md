When I was a visiting associate professor at Columbia, I was studying the work of Uhlenbeck and Taubes on Yang-Mills theory. At some point, I discovered that a crucial point was a tensor inequality that was essentially the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality but with a constant less than $1$. It was so simple and yet so powerful.

I thought this was really cool, so I went to tell Phong about it. As it happens, Eli Stein was in Phong's office. As I showed it to them, Stein erupted, "It's in my book! It's in my book!"

I went back home, pulled out Stein's book *Singular Integrals and Differentiability Properties of Functions*, and indeed there it was.

Many years later, I saw Phong and Stein together at Phong's 60th birthday conference, and Phong encouraged me to tell the story to Stein, which I did.

Here is [an explanation of the inequality](https://mathoverflow.net/a/110242/613).
