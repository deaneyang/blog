There's an old New Yorker essay written by Alfred Adler, a rather bitter one about what it was like to be a mathematician. Among other things, he promoted the myth that most mathematicians never do anything worth a damn and,, if they do anything at all, it's only while they're very young.

Adler is also known to some of us for his publication "The second fundamental forms of S6 and Pn(C)", Amer. J. Math. 91 (1969), 657â€“670, in which he claims to prove that the 6-sphere has no complex structure. His proof is considered to be incorrect.

Like many other differential geometers, I was interested in this conjecture, so I looked at Adler's paper but was never able to make heads or tails out of it. So, although the paper was clearly a mess of computations and had a questionable strategy, I had no idea why it was wrong. (I know of at least two other published "proofs" of this conjecture)

So I've asked some people over the years about the paper and got some amusing responses. The first one was from Marcel Berger. When I asked him about this paper, he responded, "that is an example of American imperialism!" He said he refereed Adler's paper and sacrificed the month of August to doing it. He said he found the error and wrote a negative report. However, according to him, Calabi wrote a one sentence report, saying "the proof appears to be correct", and the editor chose to go with Calabi's verdict over Berger's. Presumably, Calabi by then was a US citizen. Now that I think of it, I've never asked Calabi about this.

Another person I asked was Don Spencer. I was delighted and honored to meet him at a conference in Princeton, not only because of his stature as a mathematician but also because he is my mathematical grandfather. When I asked him about the paper, his response was something like "Oh, my god. Please don't mention that paper. I suffered enough". He said he had handled it as the Annals editor and had a lot of difficulty finding anyone willing to referee the paper. No one would do it. He finally found a Japanese mathematician who read the paper and apparently found an error, so he rejected the paper. Spencer did not remember who the referee was or what the error was.

Recently, I mentioned the paper in a conversation that included Robert Bryant. Robert gave a nice clear explanation of why Adler's approach could not possibly work. But of course I don't remember the details.
